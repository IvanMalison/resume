\begin{itemize}
\item Was part of a 3 person subteam that built a system for large scale data exchange relationships with partners including eat24, delivery.com and many international data providers. The system had processsed tens of millions of jobs within a few months of its completion.
\item Pushmaster: Deployed a new versions of Yelp's primary web applications for groups of as many as 20 other engineers on a bi-weekly basis. Also had service pushmaster privileges and performed service pushes for members of my team.
\item Refactored the method by which many extremely important internal metrics were calculated to reduce their run time by a factor of two. This involved 10+ tables and on the order of 100 million rows.
\item Developed expertise in Yelp's gearman based asynchronous queing system (Yelp maintains the python gearman client).
\item Was tasked with continuously monitored several of our teams most important systems. Fixed production systems on the weekend on numerous occassions.
\item Strong advocate for test driven development. Contributed several utilities to simplify the testing of distributed components of the Yelp service.
\item Led a large refactor of Yelp's datawarehouse system. Assisted with moving it from an in house MySQL cluster to Amazon Redshift.
\item Mentored and assisted interns with their projects.
\end{itemize}}

\section{Undergraduate Thesis}
\cvitem{title}{\emph{Graph Algorithms on Graphical Processing Units: The Shortest Path Problem}}
\cvitem{advisor}{James Fix}
\cvitem{description}{The GPU has shown great promise as a platform for general computation, but most of its successes have been with problems that are embarrassingly parallel. The objective of this thesis is to attempt the solution of a problem that exhibits more limited data-parallelism on the GPU. Specifically, it will examine the Shortest Path problem as it fits the aforementioned criteria and is an extremely important and well understood problem in Computer Science.}
